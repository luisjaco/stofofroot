# stofofroot
Welcome to `stofofroot` (Storage For Fruit)! A group project for my CSCI 260 (Data Structures) class! This is a Java program meant to display the data structures we've learned in the course. `stofofroot` is a program which is used for managing an inventory of fruits. It uses a combination of custom classes and data structures to create a consistent and very easy to use/maintain inventory. Classes like `Fruit`, `Purchase`, and `Shipment` are all used all of the data structures we've learned to maintain valuable information in many different ways, all contained in the `Store` class. Data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, hash tables, and binary trees are all used together to create easy lookup and intuitive methods of maintaining information.

### Usage
Simple load up the `Main` class, and run. In the class, a `Menu` instance will be created, which will handle all user menus and input.
